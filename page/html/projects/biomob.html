             During my university study, I worked on a project with a stakeholder. The stakeholder was a biologist who wanted to create a online hub where people could upload and share their evolutionary simulations. <br>
             Inside the hub you should be able to upload your simulation code with a name, a description, keywords and a demo video. Then other biologists should be able to search and filter all simulations to find your's and then download the code and try it out. <br>
             I was tasked to do the implementation and the presentation of the final product. This was my first time working in a fullstack environment and I did not use a lot of frameworks because I only got to create a very basic web application with no javascript and only basic css. But I used the templating engine extensively ro create a clean HTML hierarchy with templates.
             For this project I used HTML, CSS, MYSQL and PHP for the first time, because the university only allowed running PHP applications on their servers. <br>
             Creating the application was cancelled, because I broke up with studying and so the application never reached a complete state.
