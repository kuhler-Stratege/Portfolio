				In the last semester of my study programme, I did a three month internship at <a href="">Bootcamp Bros.</a> and helped programming the mobile game <a href="">Game of Goats</a>. This game was written in Unity with C# and I used Jetbrains Rider as IDE. <br>
				This game is a minigame collection where you play a number of them against your friends or strangers. The one who wins more minigames wins the round and gets some in-game currency that he can spend on cosmetics for his character: a goat. <br>
				The first month, I was developing a few simple minigames. One where you need to jump from platform to platform. The platforms could either be one unit of length away or two units of length leading to you pressing one or the other button. The more platforms you pass in a specific amount of time, the better. Another minigame where you need to click the correct button depending on which hand the goat raises. Each correct press is rewarded with one point and after 30 seconds the player with the most points wins. In a third mingame you needed to draw one or multiple lines based on a shown template. The fastest to complete 6 templates wins. <br>
          Implementing an MVP for each minigame took around two days of work. <br>
          During the second month, I was refactoring and rewriting some already existing minigames that had bad code quality or other issues. To improve the code quality I split up the code according to the SOLID principles and introduced a few new classes. Also a few software patterns were applied while rewriting and refactoring. One minigame was harder to refactor than expected. It had a permanent hotfix as main mechanic and many other mechanics were build around this hotfix making it difficult to also fix the code around the hotfix so that the game would run again with a proper solution. <br>
          In the third and last month I was getting some understanding of the UI code, the backend code and the localisation of the game. This was really interesting because I could see more software architecture pattern applied and could work on sending and receiving network requests in Unity which I had not done before. The solution to the problem that Unity cannot handle asynchronous tasks or multi threading was really interesting for me. This was also my first experience with localisation in programming.
