             Before starting to code I was trying out how to run a YouTube channel. It was called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kuhlerStratege" target="_blank">k√ºhler Stratege</a>". <br>
             First I was trying to do Let's play videos. I started with Let's plays to a few building games, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm0Sc4kxe1BXKWgFRkBV_Ydsy0NeOZcIH" target="_blank">simulation</a> and also did some live streams of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm0Sc4kxe1BWzPRTAHkk-J80UwcyVVfp_" target="_blank">stealth game</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm0Sc4kxe1BVjJ74TrdeafQL0cJ8djB5O" target="_blank">racing game</a>. I then tried to do a coding stream which was a failure because I realised that I cannot stream and program at the same time, so I continued doing Let's plays of games I liked. This was the only category that I did through my entire YouTube presence more or less consistently. <br>
             At some point I was looking for a tutorial for one of my favourite games: "Anno 1701". I did not find any tutorials for this game, so I decided to fill in this gap because I played the game a lot as a child. Nowadays, these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm0Sc4kxe1BVTSXgmVtnjj8BOaLhzH1BS" target="_blank">tutorial videos</a> are the most watched on my channel and so I put them on the top of my channel page. This way, I gained some knowledge about how to write notes for what I wanted to say in the video and I explored a few ways of doing research about search keywords to get new ideas for tutorial videos. I did several videos about different topics of the game and explained a few game mechanics or weird habits of the game. All of these tutorial videos gained a lot more views than my other, easier to make, Let's play videos. <br>
             My YouTube career helped me to speak more freely and to reduce my fear of speaking into a microphone to publish my content.
