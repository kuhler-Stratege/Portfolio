                Hello and welcome to my portfolio website. I am Joel KÃ¼hle, <strong>born 1999</strong> and <strong>programming is my passion</strong>.<br>
                I am <strong>programming since 2016</strong> and have always focused on games and game development. While realising my game ideas,
                I learned <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> as my two main programming languages. <br>
                Also two website projects done with <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong> are on my <a href="projectOverview.html">Project list</a>. <br>
                I am always very excited to learn more mechanics and ways to implement solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before starting to code I was trying out how to run a YouTube channel. <br>
                My channel was starting with let's plays and later on Tutorials on a specific game became my main focus. <br>
                Feel free to continue reading on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/kuhler_stratege" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not sitting in front of my computer, I like to go skateboarding in Switzerland or playing dart with a few colleagues. <br>
                You can read more about it in the <a href="others.html">miscellaneous section</a> of my page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions left, feel free to <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish you a great day and wish you a nice stay at my portfolio webpage.
