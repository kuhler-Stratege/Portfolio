             My home town is inside Germany, more precisely it is Bielefeld. I was born there and spent the most time of my childhood there, so I also went to school in Bielefeld. I started with primary school in 2006 and went to comprehensive school afterwards from 2010 on. <br>
            After finishing my mandatory school time I wanted to go to university, so I did my A level and finished it in 2019. From there on I went to university to start studying computer science with the focus on game development at the <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de">Julius-Maximilians university WÃ¼rzburg</a>. Learning new concepts of programming was really enjoyable for me and I enjoyed my time at the university. I learned a lot about algorithms and data structures, software development, game engines and game creation, AI and also a bit on other subjects I found interesting. Many projects from the <a href="">project section</a> are from this period of time. <br>
              My first game-related internship was during my last semester of my university time. It was at a small indie developer team in Cologne where I worked from remote and helped them polish their game for the release which was close. <br>
              After 3 years I left the university again in mid 2022 without a degree because I could not finish the last few lectures. <br>
               Now I am doing an apprenticeship at <a href="https://www.meteoblue.com">meteoblue</a>, which is a swiss weather company that does post processing of weather data and my part is to help improve and extend the website offers. The planned graduation is in mid 2025.
