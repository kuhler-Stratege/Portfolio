				In the last semester of my study programme, I did a three month internship at <a href="">Bootcamp Bros.</a> and helped programming the mobile game <a href="">Game of Goats</a>. This game was written in Unity with C# and I used Jetbrains Rider as IDE. <br>
				This game is a minigame collection where you play a number of them against your friends or strangers. The one who wins more minigames wins the round and gets some in-game currency that he can spend on cosmetics for his character: a goat. <br>
				The first month, I was developing a few simple minigames. One where you need to jump from platform to platform. The platforms could either be one unit of length away or two units of length leading to you pressing one or the other button. The more platforms you pass in a specific amount of time, the better. Another minigame where you need to click the correct button depending on which hand the goat raises. Each correct press is rewarded with one point and after 30 seconds the player with the most points wins. In a third mingame you needed to draw one or multiple lines based on a shown template. The fastest to complete 6 templates wins.
