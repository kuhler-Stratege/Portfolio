                After visiting a <a href="">university</a> and after the <a href="">internship</a> I am currently doing an apprenticeship at the Swiss weather company<a href="https://www.meteoblue.com">meteoblue</a>. <br>
                In this apprenticeship, I revisit the basics of programming and learn more about functional programming, dealing with NoSQL databases and web development. During a few other modules I had the first contact with ASP.net while programming the <a href="">Storescout</a> API and a Website. The best grades from this apprenticeship as well as one good grade from university can be found on my <a href="">LinkedIn page</a> in the "grades" section. <br>
                In the company I am maintaining the website of the company, which is written in PHP, Less and TypeScript. Some of my tasks included fixing bugs in the frontend and the backend, extending existing features to support more options, planning and adding completely new features and updating PHP, the framework and the local docker environment. The apprenticeship lasts three years and will be finished End of June 2025.
