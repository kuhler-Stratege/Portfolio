				My first project was a modification for minecraft where you can combine newly generated ores to create upgraded armor, tools and weapons. <br> <!-- TODO: Mit was wurde legiert? -->
				The mod contains two alloys and one varnish: One alloy for iron, one alloy for gold and one varnish for wood with tar. To get the ingredients, I first googled what is used in real life for the material of my choice and then googled the mixing ratio to include it in the game. After that I drew the textures for the blocks and items. With the textures finished I now implemented the new blocks, ores and items into my modification. For tar, I came up with an additional effect when holding tared items or blocks. As a last thing I added the block model files as well as the block and the item texture files to my modification. <br>
				In 2018, after two years of implementing this modification, I lost interest doing so and moved on.
