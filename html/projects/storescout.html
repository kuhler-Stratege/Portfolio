             </h3>
             <p>
             	This project addresses the problem that sometimes I see a product and don't know where to buy it. Food in particular cannot be bought online. That's why I would like to be able to search for a product on this website and then see which shops you can buy this product in. There should be three tables and an auxiliary table for this: a table for the products, a table for the shops and a table for the locations where the shops are located. <br>
                 In the backend, the normal user should be able to edit their own entered products and shops. Other users should be able to confirm that this product is still available in the shop or enter new shops for a product. Users should also be able to check whether a product is still available in a named shop. <br>
                 The admin should be able to moderate all entries, so they should be able to edit and delete products and stores. They should also be able to edit whether a product is available in a store. Anyone can read all entries. You should be able to search for products and stores and filter by location. <br>
          </p>
          <h3>
          	Further ideas 
          </h3>
          <p>
          	One could consider setting up a user system at a later date so that users who deliberately write incorrect entries can be blocked. To ensure that a user can only log in once in the user system, the user's fingerprint could be stored. This scanning of the fingerprint would only be necessary when registering, but could be used as an alternative to the password when logging in. The admin should be able to block accounts to ban people that do nonsense on the website.<br>
          	Another idea for a feature would be to let the user write a shopping list and the API would then tell the user where they would get their shopping at the cheapest price. The user would have to be able to set a few parameters, e.g. whether they would shop in several shops or whether they would buy a similar product from another manufacturer. This shopping list could then be linked to recipes that they have entered themselves in order to import the ingredients from the recipe directly into the shopping list and then see where the ingredients for the recipe can be found at the cheapest price. <br>
