                     When I am not sitting in front of my computer, I like to go skateboarding in Switzerland or playing dart with a few colleagues. <br>
                      I started skateboarding when I was a child. Driving a skateboard was my first time driving something where you cannot hold fast onto something. After my childhood there was a larger gap, after which I found out how I could benefit from a skateboard. Since then I am using it as a bicycle replacement whenever carrying my bicycle would be to complicated. Nowadays I am driving to school with my skateboard and sometimes I am driving through my town to the next grocery store on my skateboard. <br>
                     Also I am a huge fan of Scandinavia. I enjoy the snow during the winter and the not so hot temperatures during the summer. Furthermore the aurora borealis is a very beautiful phenomenon in my opinion. Currently I would not rate the fewer sunlight a problem for me because I don't have a problem with dark weather in the winter months and am fine to go outside hole it is dark outside.
